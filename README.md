Using greedy algorithm to perform job scheduling

## What is greedy algorithm 
A greedy algorithm is a simple, intuitive algorithm that is used in optimization problems. The algorithm makes the optimal choice at each step as it attempts to find the overall optimal way to solve the entire problem. Greedy algorithms are quite successful in some problems, such as Huffman encoding which is used to compress data, or Dijkstra's algorithm, 
which is used to find the shortest path through a graph.

## How greedy algorithm used in job scheduling (profit , deadline )?

## What if the job scheduling requires start time , end time , profit ?
Use weighted job scheduling
[weighted job scheduling]( https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/weighted-job-scheduling-log-n-time/)

## Job scheduling consists of start time & end time (duration) , profit , deadline :
Use dynamic programming with the concepts of weighted job scheduling  to ensure that no jobs are overlapped while
optimise the maximum profits .
